Bio
======
I am focused on data science. With a background in physics, I take an analytic approach to data. Working as a software engineer, I have built practical skills in software development and deployment. Utilizing my passion for learning, I am consistently expanding my expertise in software, data analysis, and machine learning.

As a test engineer, I work as part of a cross-functional team developing software and analyzing large, high-dimensional datasets. I aim to develop intuitive software that is portable and extensible. This software generates large datasets on manufactured products. I inspect data to find anomalies, determine root causes of manufacturing defects, and ensure production test quality.

I am currently pursuing a masterâ€™s degree in data science at SMU, concentrating in machine learning.
