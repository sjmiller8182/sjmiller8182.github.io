Machine learning engineer with a diverse background in semiconductor manufacturing. 
Aim to use my expertise in data mining and machine learning to improve products and processes. 
Over 3 years of experience developing production level software and data mining with Python and R.

Education
======
* M.S. Data Science, Southern Methodist University, Dec. 2020, Outstanding Graduate Award
* B.S. Engineering Physics, LeTourneau University, 2013, Magna Cum Laude
* B.S. Electrical Engineering, LeTourneau University, 2013, Magna Cum Laude

Certifications
======
* TensorFlow in Practice; 2020; Coursera-DeepLearning.AI ([View Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/1921cf9a6856be4b26fa8492fe5450bc))
* Data Analyst Nanodegree; 2018; Udacity ([View Certificate](https://confirm.udacity.com/PJSPAE4V))
* Divide & Conquer, Sorting, & Randomized Algorithms; 2017; Coursera-Stanford ([View Certificate](https://coursera.org/share/570a4dda979c558207b8a86f33a99272))

Work Experience
======
* Machine Learning Engineer at State Farm (2/2021 - Present)
  * GitLab CI/CD pipelines
  * Flask/FastAPI web API development for model service calls
  * Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS) deployments
  * Docker image development
* Test Engineer (Software Development) at Texas Instruments Inc. (2/2014 - 2/2021)
  * Extracted, transformed, and analyzed large volumes of data to ensure quality of production test programs, identify yield issues, and validate test methods.
  * Provided analyses to management for project updates and project status reviews. Communicated insights from data analysis to stakeholders through team presentations and reports.
  * Co-architected large test programs for high volume products.
  * Led development and deployment of test code libraries. These libraries helped reduce debugging efforts, user errors, and decreased program delivery time by reducing total code volume in the test program and by providing standard hardware abstractions for the user.
  * Created development operations (DevOps) tools to simplify development and deployment of test programs. Scripts were developed in python and executed automation steps such as compiling production program builds, auto-tagging program releases, and pushing new program releases out to servers.
  * Collaborated with global teams (design, manufacturing, applications, marketing, etc.) to clarify goals, solve test functionality problems, resolve quality issues, and support on-time arrival of deliverables to stakeholders.
  * Utilized git version control (BitBucket) for software development.
  * Trained two new hires and mentored three interns.
