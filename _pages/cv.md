{% include base_path %}

Curious and innovative self-starter with a passion for data analysis and learning from data.
Strong aptitude for learning new concepts and capable of turning new knowledge into actionable ideas. Ability to prioritize requirements from cross-functional teams and effectively communicate with stakeholders to achieve on-time completion of projects.

Education
======
* M.S. Data Science, SMU, Dec. 2020 (expected)
* B.S. Engineering Physics, LeTourneau University, 2013
* B.S. Electrical Engineering, LeTourneau University, 2013

Work Experience
======
* Test Engineer at Texas Instruments Inc.
  * Extracted, transformed, and analyzed high volume data to ensure production test program quality, track down yield issues, and validate test methods.
  * Provided analyses to management for project updates and project status reviews. Communicated insights from data analysis to stakeholders through team presentations and reports.
  * Co-architected large test programs for high volume devices.
  * Led development and deployment of test code libraries. These libraries helped reduce debugging efforts, user errors, and decreased program bring-up time by reducing total code volume in the test program and by providing standard hardware abstractions for the user.
  * Created development operations (DevOps) tools to simplify development and deployment of test programs. Scripts were developed in Python and executed steps such as compiling production program builds, auto-tagging program releases, and pushing new program releases out to servers.
  * Collaborated with global teams (design, manufacturing, applications, marketing, etc.) to clarify goals, solve test functionality problems, quality issues, and support on-time arrival of deliverables to stakeholders.
  * Utilized git version control (BitBucket) for software development.
